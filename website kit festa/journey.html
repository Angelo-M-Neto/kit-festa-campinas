            <strong> Humble Beginnings </strong>
            <br>
            The story of Kit Festa Campinas began in 1984, in the modest kitchen of a young couple, Luzia and Antonio. With a shared love for baking and a dream to turn their hobby into a livelihood, they started crafting homemade cakes, sweets, baked and fried savory snacks. Luzia, armed with recipes passed down through generations, brought the flavors of tradition to their creations. 
            <br>
            Their first customers were neighbors and friends who couldn’t resist the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked goods from their home. Word spread quickly, and soon their small kitchen couldn’t keep up with the demand. Encouraged by the growing popularity, the couple decided to take a leap of faith and opened their first bakery in 1987.
